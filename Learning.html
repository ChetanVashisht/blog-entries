<h3>The more you bleed in practice, the less you bleed in war</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I've always wondered about learning and what makes things stick. Recently a friend of mine reviewed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick">Make it stick</a> on Goodreads with 5 starts. So I decided to give it a read. This book challenges the existing status quo about education and wants us to change the way we learn.</p>

<h4>Current methods</h4>
<p> The current methods include rote memorisation and repetition to perfection. But these don't serve the purpose beyond temporary learning for tests/exams. Students try cramming as much knowledge as possible the before the exam so that they can pass. This goes one step further and children start optimising based on the questions being asked and hence skip certain sections of the syllabus.</p>

<p> This method of repeating until one gets it right is observed in plenty of other fields like learning music and playing a sport. This method is highly ineffective and I can vouch for it. The problem with this method is that the person feels like he's got it at the moment, but soon after the forgetting curve kicks in and it slips from his memory. I just did an online course by <a href="https://youtu.be/jFFZ0XSfCRw"> De Bono on Thinking</a> and I've already forgotten a large part of it. I barely recall 20% of the course material, so now I've to rewatch it.</p>

<h4>Recall</h4>
<p> Once we have been exposed to some new knowledge, it's important to spend some time recalling the contents. It's the best way to understand something and break the forget curve. I realise this from personal experience. Between June and December, I used to read something every night and would then explain the contents to my (ex)girlfriend. That recall would help me consolidate ideas and remember things that I'd read earlier.</p>
<p> Ideally every night one should spend some time recalling the events of the day before they go to sleep. This breaks the forget curve. Recall strengthens the neural path ways. We then tend to really understand a topic rather than just keep surface knowledge of the concept.</p>
<p> Reflection is a great form of recall. One should often question themselves as to how they could have better tackled a situation and what are the alternatives to the proposed/implemented solution. This helps consolidate ideas and build the critical neural pathways.</p>


<h4>Mix it up</h4>
<p>It's important to learn many aspects of the topic and then practice them regularly. We should learn different ideas and concepts of a particular topic and see how they may be applied. We should practice each of these so that we don't bored of repeating the same thing too many times. We also learn how many ideas can be applied in different situations.</p>
<p>For example, when practicing elementary mathematics, one should be practicing both algebra and geometry. Not just one of them until we get it right. So if one is running, then they should consider running long distance and short sprints. They should also practice other things like running on different terrains and going up and down hill etc. This kind of variations tests us to be best prepared for various circumstances and adapt to a variety of challenges as we encounter them.</p>
<p>The author suggests that for education, instead of mid term and end semester exam, colleges should opt for period tests at regular intervals (maybe 8-10 tests for a semester). This way students are forced to apply their knowledge more often, acting as a form of recall.</p>
<p>It's important to practice often. Keep practicing a core set of skills and add minimal amount of differentiating skill. One proposed idea is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system"><i>The Leitner box</i></a> which asks us to divide a set of flashcards into four boxes. The first compartment contains the parts that we are weakest at and needs most practice. The next box are the ones that we have better familiarity, so they practiced with half the frequency and so on. </p>
<p> The role of repetition is critical, but it must be done in regular intervals while being interleaved with other ideas. Have a hold on various concepts so we understand how each piece fits in the whole. The last few hours of REM sleep plays an important role in reinforcing motor skills.
