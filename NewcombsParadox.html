<h3>The best way to Predict the Future is to Create it</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p> Newcomb's paradox is a thought experiment created by William Newcomb in 1969. Even 50 years of publishing of the paradox, there is no clear consensus about the solution. After I read this problem was stuck on it for quite a few hours. I read multiple articles and watched several videos to understand it. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox">Wikipedia article</a> is good but very unintuitive. Please watch this video <i>multiple times if necessary</i> to understand the paradox.</p>

 <h4>The Paradox Statement</h4>
 <p> Imagine that in front of you are two boxes. <b>The first box (Box A) has 1000$</b> and is visible to you. <b>The second box (Box B) contains either 1,000,000$ or 0$</b> and you don't know which. <b>The contents of Box B are determined before hand</b> by an intelligent AI with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

 <p>You have to now choose one of <b>two options</b>, either <b>choose only Box B</b> or <b>choose both boxes</b>. <i>If the intelligent AI thinks that you are going to choose both boxes, then it leaves 0$ in box B. But if it decides that you will choose only Box B, then it will put 1,000,000$ in box B.</i></p>

 <p>After the prediction by the AI, you make your choice. Do you choose only Box B or both Boxes?</p>

<h4>Two Schools of Thought</h4>
 <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2016/nov/30/newcombs-problem-which-side-won-the-guardians-philosophy-poll">Several surveys</a> have been conducted asking people for whether they are one boxers or two boxers. The results of these surveys seem to be firmly divided without a clear majority. One of the two options instantly made sense to you depending on which school of though you are following.</p>

<h4>One Boxers</h4>
 <p>Since the AI makes accurate predictions about the future, it makes sense to choose just Box B. If you do Baysean analysis and assume that AI can predict 90% accurately, then the expected outcome firmly favours picking just Box B.</p>

<h4>Two Boxers</h4>
 <p>The school of thought is actually pretty simple. It doesn't matter what the AI chose, by picking both boxes, you will 1000$ more (than you would have if you picked just box B) whether the AI predicted correctly or not. </p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
 <p>After thinking about it for a long time and reading a few articles, I think I've come to a reasonable conclusion.</p>
 <p>If Box A was loaded with just 1$ instead of a 1000$ and then the experiment was repeated, then I'm pretty sure that everyone will be a one boxer.</p>
 <p>On the other hand if Box A was loaded with 1,000,000$ instead of 1000$ and then the experiment was repeated, then I'm sure that everyone will be a two boxer.</p>
 <p>When the amount in between, different people switch from one boxers to two boxers at different amount depending on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">loss aversion threshold</a>.</p>
