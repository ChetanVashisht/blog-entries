<h3>Ten years of Experience or One year of Experience ten times?</h3>
<p>
  Some of us have great memories of our schooling. Schools shape a lot of our
  future and help us become better individuals. As a kid, we I went to one of
  the better schools in Bangalore. I spent a lot of time there.
</p>
<p>
  Schools are where we learn a lot of unimportant things. It's the place where
  we spend the first fifteen years of our lives. A convenient place for "Adults"
  to drop off their children so they can carry on their lives normally.
</p>
<p>
  Schools were introduced as a way to help Industrialists generate skilled
  labour for their factories. These same roots can be observed even today, with
  the bells, uniforms and students batched by age rather than calliber.
</p>
<p>
  At the age of 13, Saina Nehwal (Indian Badminton Player) was able to
  consistently beat much older boys (20 year olds). If she had been studying in
  school like the rest of us, she could never have achieved as much as she did.
  I'm sure her school trophy case would have looked great with all the inter
  school awards. But the Olympic Broze looks a million times better. People who
  are ahead of the curve and who put in the extra effort to get better should be
  promoted faster and should be challenged by peers of similar calliber.
</p>
<p>
  Each year, students pass their mandatory exam and are promoted to the next
  grade where there is hardly any increase in difficulty of the subjects being
  taught. This means that those who are ahead or behind the bell curve are
  heavily disadvantaged. Those who are doing very well, are not challenged
  enough and those who are suffering continue to struggle every year. My
  neighbour struggled with Math for all his schooling career and continues to
  struggle to this day. I myself struggled with Kannada and English back in the
  day.
</p>
<p>
  Schools aim to make as many people as average as possible. But the real world
  doesn't work that way. People at the extreme end of the bell curve are the
  ones who generally make the difference. Everyone is really good and interested
  in some subject, but schools don't encourage this nearly enough. Hence most
  people end up becoming unemployed engineers. If you judge a frog by it's
  ability to climb a tree, you are bound to be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier students after clearing High school would start working at a factory.
  A few interested people would go to university to specialized education. It
  was actually to pick up niche and specialized education for a select section
  of the society. But now everyone does a degree because it's the new normal.
</p>
<p>
  The default degree is now an undergraduate degree. This means that by the
  first time people get a taste of the actual world they are well above the age
  of 21. The ones who go for more degrees end up with no practical experience
  until 25 or even 30. Several successful people realized this early on and
  dropped out of their respective colleges. They did go on to achieve great
  things. (Not all of them obviously, just the ones who were hard working and
  lucky enough to be seen by Survival Bias today)
</p>
<p>
  When in School, most kids lack purpose. They have no idea what's interesting
  and what the real world is like. They have no idea what money is like and how
  important is. They have no idea how people are treated in societies and what
  skills pay what kind of money.
</p>
<p>
  Most people are just doing more degrees because they don't know what else to
  do. They continue to burn their parent's cash or get burried in a massive
  student loan which will take them years to repay. The absolute worst part of
  this whole situation is that the price of education has been going by around
  15% every year for the last twenty years. For no change in syllybus and
  content that is taught in colleges/schools or change in infrastructure, yet
  the rates continue to rise.
</p>
<p>
  Without a set purpose in schools, children form pyrimidal hierarchies where
  the nerds, geeks and outcasts at the bottom get picked on continuously by
  bullies and not so popular kids to sort of establish their place in this self
  created purposeless hierarchy. This same sort hierarchy is observed among
  bickering housewives who live in a similar secluded bubble. This is the
  default reaction of a isolated system of beings who compete without purpose.
  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink">Universe 25</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The entire schooling system is horribly out of date and needs some serious
  revamping to teach kids how to deal with technology better. Children need to
  get a taste of recurring income to understand how important that is and how
  they can use this money. They should be taught about the dangers of social
  media and how it can destroy careers and even lives. Students at the ends of
  the bell curve should be encouraged more to excel further and promoted faster.
  Every person and every kid is really good at something and significantly ahead
  of the bell curve in at least a few areas and schools should help find that
  niche.
</p>
<p>
  I had a good time at school back in the day. But I wish I had been pressed
  more to perform better. Take up harder problems and solve more challenging
  questions. I'm thankful for some great years and good teachers. But
  realistically speaking, the system is out of date and needs to be
  significantly improved to incorporate the changes from the 21th century.
